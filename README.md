# Chromatin evolution

This repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce the comparative proteomics & comparative genomics analyses of our manuscript [**Comparative proteogenomics deciphers the origin and evolution of eukaryotic chromatin**](https://github.com/sebepedroslab/chromatin-evolution-analysis) (Grau-Bov√© et al. 2021).

The data and code are structured as follows:

1. **Classification of canonical and variant histones**: see `results_histones_phylo` folder. Classification of histone variants using phylogenetic and pairwise similarity approaches, and characterisation of N-terminal tails in archaea.

2. **Evolutionary analysis of the chromatin enzymatic machinery and readers**: see `results_toolkit_phylo` folder. Identification of orthologous groups in chromatin modification-related enzyme families from selected eukaryotic species, analyses of their prokaryotic homology, fusions with transposon-associated domains, and more. This folder also includes detailed instructions on how to get all the genomic data used in this study.

3. **hPTM conservation**: see `results_PTMs` folder. Includes consensus alignments and our database of histone post-translational modifications with homologous positions in each canonical histone. Here we analyse proteomics data from *Proteome Discoverer* to identify homologous PTMs.
